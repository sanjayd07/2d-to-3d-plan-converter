# 2D Blueprint to 3D Model Converter 🏠📐➡️🏗️

Convert your 2D architectural blueprints into stunning 3D models with ease!

## 🏆 Project Overview

This project was developed to address the challenge of efficiently converting 2D architectural blueprints into 3D models, a task that traditionally requires significant time and expertise.

### Our Solution

- **Problem Statement**: We addressed the challenge of efficiently converting 2D architectural blueprints into 3D models, a task that traditionally requires significant time and expertise.
- **Innovation**: Our solution leverages advanced computer vision and machine learning techniques to automate the conversion process, making it faster and more accessible.
- **Impact**: This tool has the potential to revolutionize architectural visualization, urban planning, and construction processes.

## 🌟 Features

- **Accurate Conversion**: Transform 2D blueprints into precise 3D models
- **Multiple Input Formats**: Support for various 2D blueprint file types
- **Customizable Output**: Generate 3D models in popular formats like OBJ, FBX, and GLTF
- **Texture Mapping**: Automatically apply textures for a realistic finish
- **Cloud Processing**: Leverage cloud resources for faster processing of large blueprints
